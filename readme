**This code is an active work in progress** 
Our goal is to have an app which interprects an AR code to dynamically project 3D lessons that can be viewed through the app. 
We want it to be cheap and sustainable, which is why we choose to use recycled cardboard and paper to make the cards that our AR codes are printed on.
Our app will store all the educational information on the device, allowing for the lessons to be accessed in areas that don't have reliable internet access. 
Because our education "Arise" flashcards made of recycled cardboard and paper we are able to produce the cards inexpensively, leading to lower prices that can be afforded by all learners.
We hope to provide cheaper and more convenient education to those all over the world while still providing first class hands on learning experiences. 
We believe everyone deserves a solid and personal education and as such our product is a natural choice.
